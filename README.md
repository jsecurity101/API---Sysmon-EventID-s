# Windows APIs To Sysmon-Events
A repository that maps API calls to Sysmon Event ID's. 

## API Mapping: 
### Mapping process flow is as follows:

### API mapping sheet:

[API Data Relationships Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T4sm1freM4KJk9Wu8GNxDQDRPur7159kcUji9pk03xU/edit?usp=sharing)


## API Mapping Images:
These images can be found in within the `API-Mapping-Images` directory. 


### Research Notes:
- API(A) - API accepts ASCII character strings. API(W) - API accepts wide character strings. 
- Nt(API) - User mode. Zw(API) called from kernel. If Nt(API) Zw is implied.
- API's listed are ones that were seen within the stack during a breakpoint of the event registration mechanism.
